# Predict Item Sales to Drive Profit
## Machine Learning Model Transforming Item Data into Sales

**Author**: Brian Lafferty

### Business problem:

Can raw descriptive product data be turned into a predictive model for item sales with Machine Learning?


### Data
Over 8500 item oberavtions from many different store outlets. Data included information about the product (weight, fat content, category, etc.) and sales establishment infomation (size, type, etc.).


## Methods
- Data cleaned and prepared using imputing and category standardization strategies
- Visualization of data to explore and find underlying trends
- Analyzed data using multiple machine learning models to optimize results

## Model
The machine learning model selected for this project was a regression tree. This model preformed best with the data when compared with a linear regression model. After tuning hyperparameters of the regreesion tree, it produced a R^2 value of 0.5947 on the test data.

## Results

> Identified categories with opportunity for growth and product segmentation.

#### Histogram of the Prediction Difference

> Visualizing the prediction differences in this way allows for clear understanding of the models performance.

#### Regression Tree Metrics

-   The MSE is 738.31. This shows that the models average error is $738.31 per item prediction. The average value of Item_Outlet_Sales is $2181.29, so the error represents approximately 33% of the total sales.
-   The model can predict the Item_Outlet_Sales target within $100 dollars 14.36% of the time.
-   The model had 555 predictions that were over $1000 off of the actual value. That represents approximately 26% of the predictions.
-   49% of the values had predictions over $500 from the actual value.

## Recommendations:
- I do not recommend using the Decision Tree Model for predicting the Item_Outlet_Sales
- Breakfast category should be expanded to increase market share
- Location of stores matter. Future stores should be in Outlet_Location_Type of Tier 2 or above



## Limitations & Next Steps
The regression tree model did not perform to the level I had envisioned. As I continue to learn more about Machine Learning, I will conintue to improve this analysis and strive to improve upon the results.

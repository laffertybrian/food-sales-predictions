### Project 1
This is my first project in the Coding Dojo Data Science Fundamentals and Machine Learning Course. As I progress though the course I will be adding layers to this project with my new skills.

- Part 1: Importing libraries and dataframe
- Part 2: Explore data and imputing missing values
- Part 3: Exploratory visualizations
- Part 4: Explanitory visualizations
- Part 5: Prepare data for machine learning

# Predict Item Sales to Drive Profit
## Machine Learning Model Transforming Item Data into Sales

**Author**: Brian Lafferty

### Business problem:

Transfering raw descriptive data about a product and turning it into a prediction model for item sales.


### Data
Over 8500 item oberavtions from many different store outlets. Data included information about the product (weight, fat content, category, etc.) and sales establishment infomation (size, type, etc.).


## Methods
- Data cleaned and prepared using imputing and category standaraization strategies.
- Visualization of data to explore and find underlying trends.
- Analyized data using multiple machine learning models to optimize results.

## Model
The Machine Learning Model selected for this project was a Regression Tree. This model preformed best with the data when compared with a Linear Regression model. The Regreesion Tree had a R^2 value above 0.996 when working with the test data.

## Results
-
